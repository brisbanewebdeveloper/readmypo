# About readmypo

This script requires other command "terminal-notifier". If you don't have it and have brew, do:
```brew install terminal-notifier```

## Usage

1.Register your device (your OSX machine).

  Execute the following on terminal (Device Name can be anything like iMac, MacBookPro or MyMacPro):
  ```shell
  readmypo register <Email for Pushover> <Password for Pushover> <Device Name>
  ```

  If it says "name: has already been taken", you need to delete the device at https://pushover.net/.

  Above command registers your device and get information to read the message pushed from somewhere.

   The new device can be seen at: https://pushover.net/
   The infomation gets encrypted and saved as: ~/Library/Application Support/readmypo/settings.txt

   Example Output:

       Setting is saved to /Users/example/Library/Application Support/readmypo/settings_<Device Name>.txt
       Specify this key to use read command: 12b743fqAdBfL

   The command displays the key for next step ("12b743fqAdBfL" for above example).
   Remember the key because you need it for further steps.

3. Next you test if this script can read the message.

   Execute the following on terminal:
   readmypo read <The key from Step 2> <Device Name>

   If you see nothing after waiting for about 10 seconds, you need to push something to your device.
   You can send a test message at: https://pushover.net/

   This command never finishes unless there is error.

   To finishes the command you press Ctrl + C on terminal.

4. Finally, you regsiter this script to keep running with launchd.

   cd ~/Library/LaunchAgents

   Create a file ~/Library/LaunchAgents/local.readmypo.plist:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">

    <key>Label</key>
    <string>local.readmypo</string>
    <key>ProgramArguments</key>
    <array>
        <string>/usr/bin/php</string>
        <string><REPLACE HERE TO YOUR HOME DIRECTORY>/scripts/readmypo.php</string>
        <string>read</string>
        <string><REPLACE HERE TO YOUR KEY FROM STEP 2></string>
    </array>
</dict>
</plist>
```

launchctl bootstrap gui/$UID local.readmypo.plist
launchctl enable gui/$UID/local.readmypo
launchctl kickstart -k gui/$UID/local.readmypo

If key has been changed:
launchctl unload local.readmypo.plist
launchctl bootstrap gui/$UID local.readmypo.plist
