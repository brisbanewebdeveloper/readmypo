## About readmypo

This is PHP Command Line Script to read [Pushover](https://pushover.net/) message via [Pushover API](https://pushover.net/api/client).

## Requirements

This script requires [terminal-notifier](https://github.com/julienXX/terminal-notifier).

You can install it via [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/):
```
> brew install terminal-notifier
```

## Usage

#### Register your device (your OSX machine)

Execute the following on terminal (Device Name can be anything like iMac, MacBookPro or MyMacPro):

```shell
> readmypo register <Email for Pushover> <Password for Pushover> <Device Name>
```

If it says "name: has already been taken", you need to delete the device at https://pushover.net/.

Above command registers your device and displays the command to read Pushover message.  
The registered device can be seen at: https://pushover.net/

The infomation gets encrypted and saved as ```~/Library/Application Support/readmypo/settings_<Device Name>.txt```.

Example Output:

```shell
Setting is saved to /Users/example/Library/Application Support/readmypo/settings_<Device Name>.txt
To read the message run "readmypo read 12e8a9s08e1sx <Device Name>"   <---- Use this command for next step
```

#### Test if this script can read the message

Execute the following on terminal:

```shell
> readmypo read <The key from Step 2> <Device Name>
```

If you see nothing after waiting for about 10 seconds, you need to push something to your device.
You can send a test message at: https://pushover.net/

This command never finishes.  
To finish the command you press Ctrl + C on terminal.

#### Regsiter the command to keep running with launchd

```shell
> cd ~/Library/LaunchAgents
# Create a file ~/Library/LaunchAgents/local.readmypo.plist:
```

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">

```

```shell
